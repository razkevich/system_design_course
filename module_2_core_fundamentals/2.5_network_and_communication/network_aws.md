Network is a cornerstone of cloud providers that most other services build upon. Many practice-oriented engineers neglect this topic while erroneously assuming that it is the ream of system administrators or DevOps colleagues. But this is a superficial approach because without understanding of this foundation it's impossible to debug complex outages in the cloud or be able to reason about the architecture from the high level, since networking fundamentals in the cloud is part of the inseparable part of the cloud based system. So without understanding these topics it's impossible to progress in the technical career (todo maybe rephrase it, i think it sounds awkward).

We'll take AWS as a concrete cloud provider to review cloud networking.
# AWS Basics

We first need to consider AWS basics because there are part of the bigger picture.

**AWS Account** is the top level concept where everything else lives in AWS (todo improve this definition if needed). (todo rephrahse this copy paste from a book: This account is a fundamental entity in AWS that provides access to a wide range of services. It holds all the information related to the creation, management, operations, support, and billing of your AWS resources (such as compute instances, storage, networking, etc.). With an AWS account, you can provision and configure resources, monitor usage and costs, set security and access controls, and interact with various AWS services.)

AWS customers might want to create multiple accounts:
* separation of applications (todo explain briefly)
* separation of tenants of the same application (todo explain briefly)
* (todo other reasons for separation)

Multi-account setup ensures clear separation of resources, and guarantee that actors in one account won't be able to affect other accounts.

**AWS Regions** is the next level of separation within accounts. Some resources in AWS are per region (todo give examples), while others exist for the whole account and all regions (todo give examples). Region represents a location where servers and data centers reside physically. For example, the US North Virginia region is calledÂ _us-east-1_. So customers have to choose a physical location to host their services. It's important from the performance (network latency) perspective, but also legal (todo example of gdpr), cost (todo give examples), todo give other reasons why this can be important. An option of course if to build multi-region setups.

AWS Availability Zones, Local zones and Edge Locations (todo briefly explain)

# AWS Networking services

## AWS VPC

AWS VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud. You can think of it as a "virtual data center" inside the cloud where all resources are logically grouped together and can call each other via network calls directly. (todo improve this if needed and fix false information if needed). All AWS accounts always come with one default VPC (todo per region or only one per account?). Users can create up to 5 VPCs per region (that limit can be increased). 

(todo talk about cidr blocks and ip address ranges and how they're assigned to VPCs)

So here are the properties of AWS VPSs
* shared IP address space (todo explain)
* (todo fill in other properties related to networking in AWS with VPCs)

## Subnets
(todo explain what subnets are and why they're needed, e.g. to separate high availablity with diff AZs, public/private, etc)
There's by default one subnet per VPC

# Internet connectivity

## Route tables, Security Groups and NACLs

Route table is assigned to subnet and defines rules about how resources in a subnet can contact resources outside that subnet, and vice versa - because resources inside the same subnet can contact each other without restrictions (todo improve this paragraph, add more important information and fix false info). Route tables direct network traffic in and out of a subnet. However they don't apply any filtering on the traffic.

Example of route table:

| Destination | Target |
| ----------- | ------ |
| VPC CIDR    | Local  |
| 0.0.0.0/0   | igw-id |

Security group is created at the VPC level and controls access on the resource level (e.g. the EC2 instance). It controls traffic based on protocols, ports, and IP addresses. You define inbound and outbound rules for the security group. SGs are stateful (you can get response from the AWS resource without additional configuration). Each VPC has a default SG (can't be removed), and more can be created.

Example of SG:

|Type|Protocol|Port range|Destination|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|SSH|TCP|22|117.212.92.68|Test SSH rule|
**NACLs** are created at the subnet level. They also can filter traffic like SGs, but on a subnet level, not the instance level. They can be used as an additional layer of security on top of SGs, which block the traffic if SGs are too flexible (todo rephrase the prev sentence, it's a copy paste). NACLs are stateless (responses won't be let though by default). There's one default NACL per VPC that gets attached to all subnets.

Example of NACL: 

|Rule number|Type|Protocol|Port range|Source|Allow/deny|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|100|All traffic|All|All|0.0.0.0/0|Allow|
|*|All traffic|All|All|0.0.0.0/0|Deny|
(todo summarize how Route tables, SGs, NACLs are useful, how they can be used together)

(todo create a svg summarizing how Route tables, SGs, NACLs relate with account, VPC, regions, AZs etc)

## Amazon VPC-to-Internet Connectivity

### Internet Gateway

(todo summarize what it is and how it's used and what it relates to from above)

### NAT gateway

(todo summarize what it is and how it's used and what it relates to from above)

(todo create a svg summarizing how help with internet routing)

## Connectivity Between Amazon VPCs

(todo: there's  VPC Peering, AWS Transit Gateway , AWS PrivateLink  and VPC Lattice - explain those methods briefly)

(todo create a svg summarizing how to connect between VPCs using these methods

## VPNs

(todo briefly explain how we can use VPNs with other networks/devices. give example of a data center we wanna connect to the VPC, and also example of a standalone computer who we wanna give access to the VPC resources. Draw a svg diagram and embed it here)


# Amazon Route 53 and CloudFront

(briefly mention and explain that)


## Network components

(todo explain what are the network components that AWS offers: LB, Api gw, maybe smth else? like some proxies? or smth else?)
(todo explain AWS Elastic Load Balancer, its types, when it should be used)
(todo explain Amazon API Gateway, and )
(todo explain other network components briefly)
