(todo write a medium.com style article , all in a professional natural human-like tone/style)


todo find a title to lure readers to read this medium.com article slightly click-bait-ish but not too much. The article has to be in the context of System Design for Cloud-Native SaaS Systems. all in a professional natural human-like tone/style. i'll outline the structure and give hints how to fill the sections. it has to have a structure but also not robotic and too structured, it has to be human like, like it's written by a human senior engineer, in a consistent and coherent way. feel free to modify / augment the structure if you think it brings value
# Intro (todo here and other titles - find a nicer title)
(todo -let's write what reactive programming is, what problems it solves . Write what reactive programming is and reactive system is , also mention what is reactive manifesto and provide a brief description. contrast or compare it with other related architectural styles or approaches, e.g. EDA, actors etc)

# explanation of 
(todo let's explain what key components a reactive app consists e.g. producer, observable, consumer, and the transformations - correct me if i'm confusing) and explain their responsibilities briefly. also each component let's mention what useful stuff we can do with it, for example, the transformations (or whatever it is) we can do backpressure


# reactive and cloud 
(todo write why and how reactive systems are relevant for cloud native scalable high load saas apps)

# tech stack
(todo let's write what are the main libraries . java is at the frontier (correct if i'm wrong) with libs such as rxjava (name others) and support from spring - explain in enough detail but not too long. Let's provide a quick example in java of a reactive code that demonstrates evidently the benefits of reactive approach versus a traditional approach. I want it to be concise and clear. let's mention that not only java supports it, also mention what libs/framesorks are available in go/js/python and say how popular they are

# conclusion
(todo provide short conclusion/wrapup
)
