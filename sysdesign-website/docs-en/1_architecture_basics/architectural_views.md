# Architectural Views

Software architecture is a multidimensional entity that requires multiple perspectives for comprehensive documentation. **Architectural views** represent different aspects of a system to communicate specific concerns to various stakeholders.

This document covers essential architectural views, structural perspectives, and documentation methods including the 4+1 architectural view model and C4 diagrams.

## The 4+1 Architectural View Model

The 4+1 architectural view model, developed by Philippe Kruchten, provides four fundamental views plus scenarios to comprehensively document software architecture:

### 1. Logical View

The logical view describes the functional requirements of the system and how the system provides services to end-users. It focuses on the system's functionality, showing the key abstractions and object models. This view demonstrates what the system does and how different functional elements relate to each other. 

The logical view typically shows domain objects, their relationships, and key behavioral patterns using class diagrams, object diagrams, and state machines. It emphasizes the functional decomposition and abstraction hierarchy that supports the system's core business logic and user requirements.
### 2. Process View: The Runtime Perspective

The process view (sometimes also called Components and Connectors, C&C view) shows the system's runtime architecture including processes, threads, and their interactions. This view addresses concurrency, distribution, system integrator concerns, and performance characteristics.

The process view focuses on runtime elements - processes, services, databases, message queues - and the communication mechanisms between them. Unlike the logical view, this shows what actually happens when the system is executing. It often focuses on a higher level than the logical view, and can contain multiple deployable and infrastructure units. Common patterns include client-server interactions, publish-subscribe messaging, and pipeline processing. Process views emphasize concurrency, distribution, performance characteristics, and fault tolerance.

### 3. Development View: The Implementation Perspective

The development view describes the static organization of software modules, libraries, subsystems, and development tools. This view addresses the software management concerns and shows how the system is organized from a developer's perspective. It addresses code structure, build dependencies, and development team organization.

The Development View is more concrete than traditional Module Views - it shows actual code organization (packages, libraries, build artifacts) rather than abstract functional decomposition.

The development view shows the static organization of code modules, packages, and their dependencies. It enables developers to understand the codebase structure, manage build dependencies, organize development teams, and enforce architectural constraints through module boundaries.

### 4. Physical View: The Deployment Perspective (+1)

The physical view describes the mapping of software to hardware and shows the physical deployment of the system. This view shows how software components are distributed across the infrastructure.

The physical view maps software elements to hardware infrastructure, showing deployment topology, network connections, hardware specifications, and resource allocation. This view supports capacity planning, performance optimization, disaster recovery planning, and infrastructure management.

## Quality Views: Cross-Cutting Concerns

Beyond structural views and C4, quality views address specific stakeholder concerns by focusing on particular quality attributes or non-functional requirements. While the 4+1 model covers the core structural aspects of a system, quality views overlay additional perspectives that cut across multiple structural elements.

**What are Quality Views?** Quality views are architectural perspectives that emphasize specific system qualities like security, performance, reliability, or scalability. Unlike structural views that show "what" and "where," quality views show "how well" the system achieves certain characteristics.

For example, a **security view** focuses on protection mechanisms and attack surface analysis. Shows security boundaries, trust zones, authentication/authorization flows, data encryption points, and access control mechanisms. Key elements include firewalls, load balancers with SSL termination, authentication gateways (OAuth, JWT), secrets management systems, and encrypted data stores. This view enables security teams to identify vulnerabilities, plan defense strategies, and ensure compliance with security requirements.

**Performance View** emphasizes system responsiveness, throughput, and scalability characteristics. Shows performance-critical components like CDNs for global content delivery, caching layers (Redis clusters), auto-scaling application tiers, and optimized database configurations with read replicas. Includes performance metrics, bottleneck identification, and optimization strategies. This view enables performance engineers to understand system behavior under load and plan capacity improvements.

## Documenting Behavior: Beyond Static Structure

Architecture documentation must also capture how the system behaves dynamically. Two main approaches complement the static structural views:

### Trace-Oriented Documentation

**Sequence Diagrams** show interaction flows over time between system components. They capture the temporal ordering of messages, method calls, and responses, making them effective for documenting use cases, API interactions, and complex workflows. These diagrams demonstrate the flow of control and data through the system during specific scenarios.

**Activity Diagrams** illustrate business processes and workflows, showing the flow of activities, decision points, parallel processing, and synchronization. They're particularly useful for documenting complex business logic, user journeys, and system processes that involve multiple actors and conditional flows.

### Comprehensive Documentation

**State Machine Diagrams** model element behavior and state transitions, showing how system components change state in response to events. They document reactive systems, user interface behavior, protocol implementations, and components with complex lifecycle management. These diagrams clarify valid state transitions and prevent invalid system states.

## Combining Views

Documenting architecture through separate views provides a divide-and-conquer approach, but since all structures serve the same purpose, they often have strong associations that architects must manage.

When views are closely related, **combined views** can effectively show these associations by merging elements and relations from multiple views. The simplest approach is creating **overlays** that combine information from two separate views while preserving original element and relation types. This works best when views have tight relationships and strong associations between elements, making the combined structure easier to understand than viewing them separately. However, avoid overloading combined views with too many mappings.

## C4 Model: Modern Architectural Visualization

While the C4 model is not precisely about architectural 'views' in the traditional sense, it's a complementary documentation method that's highly relevant because it provides a standardized, hierarchical approach to visualizing software architecture at different levels of abstraction. It bridges the gap between high-level system context and detailed implementation, offering a practical framework that can be used alongside or integrated with the 4+1 architectural views.

![c4](/img/c4.png)

The C4 model consists of four levels of abstraction:

### Level 1: System Context
Shows the software system you are building and how it fits into the world in terms of the people who use it and the other software systems it interacts with. This diagram focuses on people (actors, roles, personas, etc.) and software systems rather than technologies, protocols, and other low-level details. It answers the question "What is this system and how does it fit into the world?"

### Level 2: Container Diagram
Zooms into the software system and shows the containers (applications, data stores, microservices, etc.) that make up that software system. Technology decisions are also a key part of this diagram. A container represents an application or data store and is something that needs to be running in order for the overall software system to work. This level shows the overall shape of the architecture and technology decisions.

### Level 3: Component Diagram
Zooms into an individual container to show the components inside it. These components should map to real abstractions (e.g., a grouping of code) in your codebase. Components are the major structural building blocks of your code - think of them as a collection of functionality behind a well-defined interface. This diagram identifies the major structural building blocks and their interactions within a specific container.

### Level 4: Code Diagram
Zooms into an individual component to show how that component is implemented at the code level, showing the code elements (interfaces, classes, etc.) that make up the component. This level provides the implementation details that developers need, though it's often better to generate these automatically from IDEs rather than maintain them manually.


**C4 + DDD Integration** works particularly well together - System Context maps to domain boundaries, Container diagrams show bounded contexts as deployable units, and Component diagrams reveal domain aggregates and services within each context. **Event Storming** provides a collaborative workshop approach to discover domain boundaries, aggregates, and bounded contexts through business event mapping. This directly informs the Logical View by revealing natural functional decomposition based on domain events. **Context Mapping** offers strategic design patterns for defining relationships between bounded contexts (Shared Kernel, Customer/Supplier, Anti-corruption Layer), which directly translates to Process View documentation showing how different domain services interact.

## Enterprise Architecture Frameworks: Comprehensive View Systems

While the 4+1 model and C4 provide foundational approaches, several enterprise architecture frameworks offer comprehensive, standardized view systems out of the box:

**ArchiMate** (The Open Group) is the most comprehensive, providing a structured modeling language with predefined layers and viewpoints:
- **Three Core Layers**: Business (processes, actors, services), Application (components, interfaces), Technology (infrastructure, networks)
- **Cross-cutting Aspects**: Motivation (goals, requirements), Strategy (capabilities, resources), Implementation & Migration
- **25+ Standard Viewpoints**: Service Realization, Process Cooperation, Application Usage, Infrastructure Usage, etc.

**TOGAF ADM** provides the Architecture Development Method with standard architectural domains: Business, Data, Application, and Technology Architecture.

**DoDAF/MODAF** (Defense frameworks) offer comprehensive viewpoint systems:
- **Operational Viewpoints**: Mission, processes, activities
- **Systems Viewpoints**: Systems, interfaces, functionality  
- **Technical Standards Viewpoints**: Standards, rules, criteria

These frameworks eliminate ad-hoc architectural documentation by providing standardized vocabularies, notation systems, and predefined view structures. ArchiMate, in particular, offers the most mature "out of the box" solution for organizations requiring comprehensive architectural modeling with minimal setup overhead.

## Conclusion

Architectural views are communication tools that enable effective collaboration across development organizations. The 4+1 model, C4 diagrams, and behavioral documentation methods create architecture documentation that serves stakeholders.

Effective architectural documentation starts with stakeholder needs, uses appropriate views and notations, and maintains documentation as a living artifact that evolves with the system.
