# Network Components for Distributed Systems

Modern web applications depend on critical network components that enable scaling, resilience, and global performance. This material covers essential building blocks for distributed system architecture: load balancers, API gateways, proxies, CDNs, and supporting infrastructure components.

## Load Balancers

Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers, enabling horizontal scalability, fault tolerance, and improved response times. They provide a single entry point for clients while automatically routing traffic away from failed servers.

Load balancing evolved from expensive hardware appliances (F5, Citrix) to flexible software solutions (HAProxy, NGINX) to today's cloud-native managed services (AWS ALB, Google Cloud Load Balancing, Kubernetes ingress controllers).

### Types of Load Balancers

Choosing the right type of load balancer depends on your specific requirements and where you need to distribute traffic in your network stack.

**DNS Load Balancers** such as AWS Route 53 operate at the domain resolution level, returning different server IP addresses to different users. These solutions excel at geographic distribution and simple failover scenarios, though DNS caching can delay updates during server failures. Primary use cases involve directing users to optimal data centers.

**ECMP Routers** from vendors including Juniper and Cisco operate at the network level, distributing traffic across multiple equal-cost paths. These solutions provide optimal performance in data center environments requiring traffic distribution across multiple network links without creating single points of failure.

**Network Load Balancers (Layer 4)** such as AWS NLB focus exclusively on IP addresses and ports, delivering exceptional performance with ultra-low latency capabilities exceeding millions of requests per second. These solutions are optimal for scenarios requiring raw performance without complex routing logic, such as high-frequency trading platforms or real-time gaming backends.

**Application Load Balancers (Layer 7)** such as AWS ALB inspect HTTP request content to make intelligent routing decisions while distributing traffic across multiple application instances. HTTP content inspection enables advanced features including sticky sessions through cookie-based session affinity. When users first access applications, ALBs can insert cookies ensuring subsequent requests reach the same backend server. This capability is essential for applications storing session data locally rather than in shared session stores. While requiring more processing power than Layer 4 load balancers, they provide necessary functionality for session persistence and content-aware routing.

### Load Balancing Algorithms

Load balancer traffic distribution algorithms significantly impact application performance and user experience.

**Static algorithms** use predetermined rules independent of server conditions. Round Robin cycles through servers sequentially (server 1, 2, 3, then back to 1), functioning effectively when servers have similar capacity. Weighted Round Robin enables weight assignment to servers, allowing powerful servers (weight 3) to receive three times more requests than smaller servers (weight 1). Hash-based algorithms ensure consistent user-to-server mapping through consistent hashing of IP addresses or session IDs.

**Dynamic algorithms** adapt to real-time server conditions. Least Connections routes requests to servers with the fewest active connections, optimizing for varying request processing times. Least Response Time considers both connection count and server response speeds. Least Loaded examines actual server resource utilization including CPU and memory usage.

**Sticky sessions** (session affinity) ensure users consistently reach the same server. Cookie-based affinity functions exclusively with Layer 7 load balancers, inserting cookies to remember user-server assignments. Source IP affinity routes based on user IP addresses and supports both Layer 4 and 7 load balancers.

### Production Considerations

Production load balancer deployments require several essential features for reliability and security maintenance.

Health checks provide early failure detection through continuous HTTP requests or TCP connections to verify server responsiveness. When servers fail health checks, traffic automatically reroutes to healthy servers, typically within seconds of problem detection.

SSL termination significantly improves performance and management by centralizing encryption and decryption processing at the load balancer level. This approach centralizes certificate management, eliminating the need to update certificates across numerous servers while enabling application servers to focus on business logic.

DDoS protection and rate limiting shield backend services from malicious attacks and unexpected traffic spikes. Many cloud load balancers integrate with Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to provide comprehensive protection without additional configuration complexity.

Modern load balancer caching capabilities significantly reduce backend load by storing frequently requested responses. While less sophisticated than dedicated CDNs, load balancer caching effectively handles API responses and dynamic content with low change frequencies.

### Cloud Implementations

Cloud providers have simplified load balancing through managed services that handle operational complexity.

**AWS** provides three main options: Application Load Balancer (ALB) for HTTP/HTTPS traffic with all the Layer 7 features you'd expect, Network Load Balancer (NLB) for high-performance TCP/UDP traffic, and Classic Load Balancer for legacy applications (though you should probably migrate away from this one).

**Kubernetes** takes a different approach with Services providing internal load balancing within your cluster, while Ingress controllers handle external traffic with advanced routing features. The beauty of Kubernetes is that it can automatically provision cloud provider load balancers when you need them, abstracting away much of the complexity through simple YAML configurations.


## API Gateways

While load balancers excel at distributing requests among identical servers, API gateways address API complexity management across distributed architectures. Though commonly associated with microservices, API gateways provide value in service-oriented architectures (SOA), hybrid cloud deployments, and monolithic applications exposing multiple API endpoints. API gateways function as centralized request routing systems that direct requests to appropriate services.

Unlike load balancers that distribute requests across identical service instances, API gateways make intelligent routing decisions based on request characteristics. Requests to `/users/profile` route to user services on specific servers, while `/orders/history` requests route to order services on different servers.

### What Makes API Gateways Special

API gateways excel in areas extending beyond traffic distribution. They centralize security concerns including OAuth flows, JWT token validation, API key management, and role-based access control, eliminating the need for individual service implementations. This enables single authentication implementation at the gateway level rather than duplication across numerous backend services.

Rate limiting and throttling protect backend services from malicious abuse and unintentional system overload. Different API tiers can have varying limitsâ€”for example, free tier users might receive 300 requests per 15-minute window, while enterprise customers receive higher limits based on subscription levels.

Request and response transformation demonstrates significant API gateway value through protocol translation (REST to GraphQL), data format conversion, and API versioning without backend code modifications. These capabilities are essential for maintaining backward compatibility and legacy system integration.

Monitoring and analytics provide insights into actual API usage patterns, including popular endpoints, service error rates, and performance bottlenecks before they impact users.

Gateway-level caching reduces backend service load and improves response times for frequently requested data.

### Choosing the Right Solution

Product evolution has blurred distinctions between API gateways and load balancers as solutions incorporate features from both categories.

Hybrid solutions including Kong, Ambassador, and Istio Gateway combine advanced API management features with high-performance load balancing. These solutions provide unified tooling for both concerns but may require more complex configuration and operation.

Pure API gateways such as AWS API Gateway, Google Cloud Endpoints, and Azure API Management focus on API management features. These typically fully managed services integrate well with respective cloud ecosystems but may have performance limitations in high-throughput scenarios.

Pure load balancers including AWS NLB, basic HAProxy, and F5 BIG-IP excel at high-performance traffic distribution but require additional tooling for API management features.

### Cloud & Kubernetes Integration

AWS API Gateway provides fully managed API hosting with Lambda integration, supporting both REST and HTTP APIs (HTTP APIs offer better performance and lower costs for simpler use cases).

Kubernetes environments commonly utilize NGINX Ingress Controllers and Traefik for basic routing, while service mesh solutions like Istio provide advanced gateway functionality. Cloud-native solutions such as Kong for Kubernetes deliver enterprise API management features directly within clusters.

## Proxies

Proxies are essential components of network infrastructure, sitting between clients and servers to handle caching, security, and optimization tasks that would otherwise burden your applications.

### Forward Proxies: Acting on Behalf of Clients

Forward proxies intercept client requests before they reach destinations. From server perspectives, all requests appear to originate from the proxy rather than individual users.

Forward proxies are common in corporate environments for internet access filtering, bandwidth conservation through caching, and user anonymity. Squid serves as a standard choice for enterprise deployments, while developers utilize Charles Proxy or Burp Suite for API debugging. Cloud-based solutions like Zscaler have gained popularity for distributed workforces.

Forward proxies enable centralized security policies and bandwidth optimization but may introduce latency and create single points of failure without proper high-availability design.

### Reverse Proxies: Acting on Behalf of Servers

Reverse proxies operate inversely, intercepting incoming requests before they reach backend applications. Clients typically remain unaware they are communicating with proxies rather than actual servers.

Reverse proxies excel at SSL termination (handling all the encryption/decryption work), caching static content to improve response times, routing requests to appropriate backend servers, and compressing responses to reduce bandwidth usage.

From a security standpoint, reverse proxies are invaluable. They hide details about your backend infrastructure, provide DDoS protection through rate limiting, can include Web Application Firewall functionality, and centralize logging for all incoming traffic.

NGINX and Apache HTTP Server are popular choices for self-hosted solutions, while Cloudflare provides a globally distributed reverse proxy service. It's worth noting that the line between reverse proxies and load balancers has become increasingly blurredâ€”many modern reverse proxies like NGINX Plus and HAProxy include sophisticated load balancing features, while load balancers often include reverse proxy capabilities like SSL termination and caching. The key is careful configurationâ€”a poorly configured reverse proxy can easily become a bottleneck that limits your entire application's performance.

## Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

Serving high-resolution images to Tokyo users from New York servers involves thousands of miles of fiber optic cable transmission, adding hundreds of milliseconds of latency. CDNs address this challenge by distributing content across geographically dispersed servers, positioning content closer to users worldwide.

### How CDNs Transform User Experience

When Tokyo users request images, CDN routing systems direct them to Japanese edge servers that either have cached content or can quickly fetch from regional servers. Geographic proximity typically reduces latency by 50-80%, significantly benefiting media-heavy applications and e-commerce sites where millisecond improvements impact conversion rates.

Static assets including images, CSS files, and JavaScript bundles are cached for extended periods due to infrequent changes. Dynamic content may receive brief caching or none at all, though modern CDNs increasingly support intelligent personalized content caching at edge locations.

### Beyond Simple Caching

Modern CDNs have evolved beyond simple content caching to include edge computing capabilities that enable serverless function execution at edge locations, processing requests without origin server round-trips. AWS CloudFront Functions, Cloudflare Workers, and Fastly Compute@Edge exemplify this trend, supporting content personalization and simple API request handling at edge locations.

Security features have gained equal importance in modern CDN implementations. Contemporary CDNs include Web Application Firewall protection, DDoS mitigation, bot detection and management, and SSL/TLS optimization with current security protocols. Many attacks are blocked at edge locations before reaching origin servers.

Real-time analytics provide detailed insights into user behavior, performance metrics, and security threats across all edge locations, including content loading speeds, user geographic distribution, and popular content access patterns.

### Choosing and Implementing a CDN

Major providers including Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN, Fastly, and Akamai each offer distinct strengths. Global hyperscale providers offer extensive networks with integrated cloud services, while specialized solutions may provide superior real-time content updates or developer-friendly APIs.

Successful implementation requires careful attention to cache invalidation strategies for globally cached content updates, origin server configuration for efficient cache miss handling, comprehensive monitoring to track performance improvements, and cost management due to potential dramatic CDN usage scaling with traffic.

## Additional Critical Network Components

Modern distributed systems rely on specialized network infrastructure components beyond core elements to address specific architectural challenges.

### Service Mesh: The Microservices Communication Layer

As organizations decompose monolithic applications into numerous microservices, service-to-service communication management becomes increasingly complex. Service meshes including Istio, Linkerd, and Consul Connect address this challenge through dedicated infrastructure layers for service communication.

Implementation occurs through sidecar proxiesâ€”small proxy servers deployed alongside each service to handle all network communication. This approach provides features including mutual TLS encryption, traffic management, load balancing, and detailed observability without application code modifications. Services make standard HTTP calls while the service mesh handles underlying complexity.

### Web Application Firewalls: Your First Line of Defense

Web Application Firewalls operate at the application layer, filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic based on predefined rules. They provide defense against common attacks including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

Modern WAFs including AWS WAF, Cloudflare WAF, and F5 Advanced WAF integrate with CDNs, load balancers, and API gateways, providing comprehensive protection without latency penalties. Many solutions learn from traffic patterns to automatically block suspicious requests before they reach applications.

### DNS and Service Discovery: Finding Services in Dynamic Environments

Traditional DNS functions well for static infrastructure, but modern containerized environments require dynamic solutions. Service discovery systems including Consul, etcd, and Kubernetes DNS enable automatic service location and communication as services scale and migrate across infrastructure.

Modern DNS solutions have evolved beyond domain resolution to provide intelligent traffic routing, health-based failover, and geographic load balancing. These solutions integrate with service discovery to create resilient, self-healing network architectures.

## System Integration

Network components operate as interconnected ecosystems that transform complex distributed architectures into seamless user experiences rather than functioning in isolation.

User requests may first encounter CDN edge servers, which route traffic through WAFs for security screening, then to load balancers distributing traffic across API gateways. These gateways may utilize service mesh infrastructure for backend microservice communication, while reverse proxies handle SSL termination and caching throughout the process.

Effective system design requires understanding both individual components and their complementary relationships. Well-architected systems employ load balancers for scaling, API gateways for microservice orchestration, proxies for security and performance optimization, CDNs for global reach, and specialized components like service meshes and WAFs for resilience and protection.

Distributed system design should treat these components as specialized tools, selecting appropriate solutions for specific challenges while maintaining flexibility to evolve architecture as requirements grow.
