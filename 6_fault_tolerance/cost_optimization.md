(todo write a medium.com style article , all in a professional natural human-like tone/style)


todo find a title to lure readers to read this medium.com article slightly click-bait-ish but not too much. The article has to be in the context of System Design for Cloud-Native SaaS Systems. all in a professional natural human-like tone/style. i'll outline the structure and give hints how to fill the sections. it has to have a structure but also not robotic and too structured, it has to be human like, like it's written by a human senior engineer, in a consistent and coherent way. feel free to modify / augment the structure if you think it brings value

# intro (find a better title of the section here and elsewhere)

let's start by saying how relevant this is for any kind of org. say that the demand for such skills is extremely high, . Augment all above points with real world examples and insights , ideally focused on $ dollars (savings, losses, market size, salaries etc). let's say the topic is vast but here we'll focus on three things: 1 - optimizing resource utilization within an app and righsizing it (let's focus on java/spring including some modern jvms or frameworks but also configuring java opts, and mention that these methods are also available for other languages/plafroms) 2- what methods / systems clouds like aws provides to monitor costs (and 3rd party systems too such as cloudhealth; best practices like alerting, monthly review, etc, anything i haven't thought of that's important) 3 - choosing right usage models and services (e.g. spot instances or reserved instances; let's explain when lambdas make or don't make sense financically; or another example is EMR serverless vs EMR over k8s , or give other better examples instead of these; i also heard there's some business model of sharing aws or using it via some service provider that buys it in bulk from aws that makes it less expensive. also let's talk about migrating to self hosted or other clouds, and pros/cons of going multi-cloud from the financial standpoint; and i want you to come up with other great ideas i haven't thought ; basically what methods / systems cloud like aws provides to cut costs 4 - conclusion (quick wrap up). i want one section per each of these items
